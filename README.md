* [PSR-15: HTTP Server Request Handlers](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/)
* [PSR-7: HTTP message interfaces](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/)
* [PSR-17: HTTP Factories](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/)

For PSR-7, `guzzlehttp/psr7` is referenced.

A conclusion about it has been drawn, that if we adopt PSRs for web, the cost would be huge.
